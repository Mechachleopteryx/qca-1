        "Most of the time, the Qubit state is unstable, we don't know in which state it is until we take a look at it.",
        "This is inherently due to the <b>spin property</b> of particles. We can't know in which direction they spin until we measure it. And once we measure it, we change the way it's spinning.",
        "This phenomenon is way more complex, it's one of the basic principle of <b>Quantum physics</b>, but here we won't get into details.",
        "What you need to remember is that we need to measure the system to stop it and know in which state qubits are.",
        "For this, we will need an observer : an <b>Output Block</b>"
